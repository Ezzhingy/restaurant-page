# restaurant-page
Restaurant page generated dynamically using JavaScript

Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Compiled npm and webpack. From this project, I learned how to:
- Set up a package.json file, install packages, and manage assets with webpack.config.js
- Use the background CSS property to improve the look of the website
